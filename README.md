# react-openai-vision-app-acorn
This is the UI for building out our Vision App.

This project is made for tutorial purposes and following along using an Acorn.io acorn.

We will start up this project so that everyone can start off in the same place and have the same dependency versions. Once everyone has deployed their acorn, we can continue coding the backend out together.
